## DISCLAIMER - for i furbetti

Remember that this is LICENCED software, so it's not ok if you literally copy and paste dozens of lines of code. There are engines that can verify that, we are open to
collaboration, but we hate when programmers takes credit for our work. So, if you crazy robbers are reading this, remember to contact us, otherwise we will use 
our right to report the robbery. Don't forget that even open source projects have boundaries, there's no shame in looking and forking other teams' projects, we would love to collaborate, but remember that it's not ok to take credit for other people's work.

### Why this?

We have solid proof that another programming team used our design architecture, which is completely original, since we invented this game engine.

### Bullet Ballet

Bullet Ballet is a 2D platformer developed for a University Project at the _Alma Mater Studiorum_ of Bologna by
	Leon Baiocchi, Alessandro Pioggia, Federico Brunelli, Luca Rengo.

The goal of the game is that of surviving the level's enemies, traps, potions and get to the end of it.
The player is allowed to pickup items that will help him/her to go through the level like weapons, health and coins for the in-game economy.

At the end of the match, the player's name and score will be saved and will be showed in the in-game stats panel.
